About This Project
Hi everyone! I’ve just completed my first year of B.Tech, and during my summer break, I took the opportunity to start learning HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript. As part of my learning journey, I built this YouTube Frontend Clone using only HTML and CSS.
What I Learned
While building this project, I gained a strong understanding of:

1.Flexbox – to align and space elements efficiently
2.CSS Grid – to build complex, responsive layouts
3.Nested Layouts – to organize sections inside each other for better design

This hands-on project helped me see how HTML and CSS work together in real-world UI development. It’s entirely beginner-friendly and focuses purely on frontend fundamentals.

Why I Recommend This Project to Beginners
1.It’s perfect for beginners – no JavaScript or backend required.
2.Built completely using HTML and CSS – no frameworks or libraries involved.
3.Clarifies important layout concepts like Flexbox, Grid, and nesting.
4.Gives you the feel of designing a real-world app UI.

What’s Next?
I built this project to strengthen my HTML and CSS knowledge. I’m currently learning JavaScript and will soon move on to backend technologies. My goal is to improve this project by:

1.Adding JavaScript interactivity
2.Building a fully functional frontend
3.Eventually connecting it to a backend to make it a full-stack application
